Description: Frequentist and Bayesian linear regression for large data sets. Useful 
    when the data does not fit into memory (for both frequentist and Bayesian regression), 
    to make running time manageable (mainly for Bayesian regression), and to reduce 
    the total running time because of reduced or less severe memory-spillover into 
    the virtual memory. This is an implementation of Merge & Reduce for linear regression
    as described in Geppert, L.N., Ickstadt, K., Munteanu, A., & Sohler, C. (2020).
